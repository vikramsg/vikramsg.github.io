I am a PostDoc at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.
I work at the boundary between mathematics and code development. 
Developing code to solve real world problems 
require pushing the boundaries of both which is my goal. 
This involves developing techniques to make physics models robust
and efficient.

I am also interested in how machine learning can be used to improve physics modelling for fluids. 
We already use many different models which need to be tuned. 
Machine learning in theory should be able to make that easier. 

At MPIM, I work on the ocean model ICON-O. 
Keeping climate models stable is a complex problem and 
requires careful analysis of the numerical method. 
I have been working on improving the structure preserving numerics of ICON-O 
to push the model towards more flexibility and stability.

I did my PhD at Technion, Israel.
I worked on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, an arbitrary high-order, 
unstructured method for the solving the compressible Navier Stokes (CNS) equation. 
I wrote the solver in C++ making extensive use of the [MFEM](https://github.com/mfem/mfem) library.
I developed the techniques required to make the solver
robust and efficient.
