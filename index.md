I am a Software Engineer working at Cervest working to bring 
ML models to life that predict physical risk to customer assets due to climate change. 

In a past life, I spent a few years in academia working on various computational physics problems.
I was a PostDoc at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology where I worked on the ocean model ICON-O. 
Keeping climate models stable is a complex problem and 
requires careful analysis of the numerical method. 
I worked on improving the structure preserving numerics of ICON-O 
to push the model towards more flexibility and stability.

I did my PhD at Technion, Israel.
I worked on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, an arbitrary high-order, 
unstructured method for the solving the compressible Navier Stokes (CNS) equation. 
I wrote the solver in C++ making extensive use of the [MFEM](https://github.com/mfem/mfem) library.
I developed the techniques required to make the solver
robust and efficient.
