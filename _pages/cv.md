## Experience

### Cervest 
Software Engineer<br/> 
*Jan 2022 – Present*

At Cervest, I work on productionizing ML models that predict physical risk for customer assets due to climate change.  


### Max Planck Institute for Meteorology
Postdoctoral Researcher<br/> 
*Jul 2019 – Dec 2021*

At MPIM, I work on the ocean model ICON-O. Keeping climate models stable is a complex problem and requires careful analysis of the numerical method. I have been working on improving the structure preserving numerics of ICON-O to push the model towards more flexibility and robustness.

### Aeronautical Development Agency
Scientist<br/> 
*Aug 2009 – Oct 2015*

At ADA, I worked on concept design for a new aircraft project. I used Genetic Algorithms and CFD to derive optimised configurations. I built a Multi-Disciplinary Optimization framework in Python which allowed constraints such as weight, volume and signature to be included. I won the DRDO young scientist award for this work.


## Education

### Technion 
PhD in Mechanical Engineering<br/>
*Oct 2015 – Jul 2019*

I worked on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, an arbitrary high-order, unstructured method for the solving the compressible Navier Stokes (CNS) equation. High order methods suffer from aliasing instabilities which leads to robustness issues. I showed that we can solve this issue if we used split forms. In addition, split forms work well with wall modeling to enable high Reynolds' number flows.  

### IIT Kanpur 
BTech-MTech in Aerospace Engineering<br/>
*Aug 2004 – May 2009*

I worked on airfoil design to optimize for bypass transition.
I developed a FORTRAN code for design using B-splines 
and introduced a new technique to optimize airfoil flow characteristics.
